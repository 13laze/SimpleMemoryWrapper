# SimpleMemoryWrapper
This is a bad simple wrapper for writing to memory using the Windows API.  
This is made primarely for myself so that I don't have to go through extra typing.

# Instructions for use in Visual Studio
1. The first thing you need is to start an empty project using Visual Studio.
2. Copy memwrapper.h and memwrapper.cpp to your main working directory (Source Files).
3. To include the code in your main script, do #include "memwrapper.h" and make sure to include namespace MemoryWrapper.
4. From there you can create a new Memory object and use the functions provided.
