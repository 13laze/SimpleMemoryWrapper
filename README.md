# SimpleMemoryWrapper
This is a very simple wrapper for writing to memory using the Windows API. 
It's not expected to be good, it's just here to document my progress while learning

# How to use it (if anyone does)
Copy the git repository using git from the terminal or by directly downloading the zip file
```
git clone https://github.com/13laze/SimpleMemoryWrapper.git
```

If you downloaded the zip file make sure to extract the folder from it, though that should be obvious.  
To use in your project simply add the files in the working directory and from there it will depend on your working environment.

Not expecting anyone to use it beside mnyself because HAPI but yeah here it is.
